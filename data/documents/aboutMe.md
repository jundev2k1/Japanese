Hello there! It's a pleasure to meet you. My name is Tan (Jun Dev) and I am a 22-year-old developer and designer, as well as a content creator. Currently, I work as an employee at W2 Solution Vietnam.

Aside from my professional life, I have a few hobbies and interests that keep me busy during my free time. I love playing the guitar, taking photographs, playing football, and cooking up a storm in the kitchen.

Recently, I decided to challenge myself by creating a website dedicated to learning Japanese. I created this website with the intention of improving my skills and expanding my knowledge on the language. Since May 15th, I have been working tirelessly to improve and develop this website, and I am excited to see what the future holds for it.

Thank you for taking the time to read a bit about me. If you have any questions or just want to say hello, feel free to reach out!
